# js-oop-book
Created a Javascript CRUD Book adding simple web interface. Will add localstorage feature as well later on.

# How it works
Fill up all the form fields to add a book instance on the bottom area and all the books created will be listed on there. There will be a X button on each list item to delete that list item (book) from the list. There will be notification messages as well when you add/remove a book or try to submit without filling all the form fields.
**Everything was done on OOP JS**
